This is a repo for CS 201 Test Cases

#Instructions:
1. Add CDA class to src/CDA.cpp
2. Run `make` in terminal. It takes ~30 seconds the first time, but runs in less than a second after the initial run.

To disable a test case, just comment it out in tests/CDA.cpp. 

Ignore tests/catch.hpp and tests/main.cpp.

Uses the [Catch2 testing library](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
